## Image Generator using API
A simple and elegant web application that generates images from textual descriptions using the Hugging Face Inference API. This project demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI models into a user-friendly front-end interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## üìñ About The Project
This project was created to provide a straightforward example of how to interact with AI models for image generation. Users can type in a creative prompt (e.g., "An astronaut riding a horse on Mars, photorealistic"), and the application will communicate with a pre-trained model on Hugging Face to generate and display a unique image based on that input.

The primary goal is to showcase a practical application of front-end web development skills and API integration.

## ‚ú® Features
Responsive Design: A clean and modern UI that works on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Dynamic Image Generation: Enter any text prompt to generate an image in near real-time.

API Integration: Seamlessly connects to the Hugging Face API to leverage powerful AI models.

Loading State: Provides visual feedback to the user while the image is being generated.

Error Handling: Displays a user-friendly message if the API call fails or an error occurs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
This project is built with modern web technologies and a powerful AI API.

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- Hugging Face Inference API

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites
You will need an API token from Hugging Face to use the image generation model.

- Go to Hugging Face.

- Create an account or sign in.

- Navigate to your profile settings and find "Access Tokens".

- Create a new token with "read" permissions.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Generator-using-API.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Image-Generator-using-API
```

## Add your API Token:

- Open the script.js (or equivalent) file.

- Find the placeholder for the API token and replace it with your own token.

- const API_TOKEN = 'YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN';

- Open index.html in your browser:

Simply double-click the index.html file or use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's Live Server) to view the project.

## üñºÔ∏è How to Use
- Open the application in your web browser.

- You will see an input field and a "Generate" button.

- Type a descriptive text prompt into the input field. For example: "A cute cat programming on a laptop".

- Click the "Generate" button.

- Wait for a moment while the AI processes your request. A loading indicator will be visible.

- The generated image will appear on the screen!
